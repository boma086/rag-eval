# Continuous Evaluation Module

This module enables continuous evaluation of RAG systems, allowing for ongoing monitoring of performance.

## Features

1. **Scheduled Evaluations**
   - Run evaluations at regular intervals
   - Support for cron-like scheduling
   - Configurable evaluation frequency

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track metric scores over time
   - Detect performance degradation
   - Alert on significant changes

3. **A/B Testing**
   - Compare different versions of RAG systems
   - Evaluate impact of configuration changes
   - Statistical significance testing

4. **Feedback Integration**
   - Incorporate user feedback into evaluation
   - Adjust evaluation weights based on feedback
   - Continuous improvement of evaluation process

## Implementation Plan

1. **Scheduler**
   - Use libraries like APScheduler for task scheduling
   - Implement configurable schedules
   - Handle task persistence and recovery

2. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Real-time performance metrics display
   - Historical performance charts
   - Alerting system for performance issues

3. **A/B Testing Framework**
   - Implement experiment design
   - Statistical analysis of results
   - Reporting of A/B test outcomes

4. **Feedback Loop**
   - Interface for collecting user feedback
   - Mechanisms for incorporating feedback into evaluation
   - Automated adjustment of evaluation parameters

## Usage Example

```python
from continuous_evaluator import ContinuousEvaluator

# Initialize continuous evaluator
evaluator = ContinuousEvaluator()

# Schedule daily evaluations
evaluator.schedule_evaluation('daily', '0 0 * * *')

# Start monitoring
evaluator.start_monitoring()

# Run A/B test
evaluator.run_ab_test('ragflow_v1', 'ragflow_v2', duration_days=7)
```
