# Technical Accuracy Metric

This module implements a custom metric for evaluating the technical accuracy of RAG responses in the context of Japanese software development.

## Implementation Plan

1. Define criteria for technical accuracy in software development context
2. Implement comparison logic between RAG response and ground truth
3. Calculate accuracy score based on predefined criteria
4. Integrate with the main evaluation framework
