# Advanced Evaluation Metrics

This module implements advanced evaluation metrics that go beyond the standard Ragas metrics.

## Metrics Included

1. **Consistency Score**
   - Measures how consistent the RAG system's answers are with the provided context
   - Implementation would compare statements in the answer with facts in the context

2. **Novelty Score**
   - Evaluates whether the RAG system provides new insights beyond what's in the context
   - Balances between hallucination (negative) and valuable synthesis (positive)

3. **Cultural Appropriateness**
   - Specifically for Japanese software development context
   - Evaluates if the response considers Japanese business practices and cultural norms

4. **Implementation Feasibility**
   - Assesses how feasible the suggested solutions are in practice
   - Considers factors like time, cost, and technical constraints

## Implementation Approach

Each metric will be implemented as a separate class that inherits from a base metric class.
The metrics will use the configured LLM evaluator to make judgments about the responses.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseAdvancedMetric(ABC):
    def __init__(self, evaluator):
        self.evaluator = evaluator
    
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate(self, question, answer, contexts, ground_truth):
        pass

class ConsistencyScore(BaseAdvancedMetric):
    def calculate(self, question, answer, contexts, ground_truth):
        # Implementation here
        pass
```
