This module implements a custom metric for evaluating the appropriateness of RAG responses in Japanese language context.

## Implementation Plan

1. Define criteria for language appropriateness in Japanese software development context
2. Implement language analysis logic (could integrate with tools like Mecab for Japanese text analysis)
3. Calculate appropriateness score based on predefined criteria
4. Integrate with the main evaluation framework
