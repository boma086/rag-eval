# Evaluation Results

This document will contain the results of our RAG evaluations.

For the sample test case:
- Question: "How should we implement user authentication in our new Japanese language learning app?"
- Expected answer based on historical document: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens, bcrypt for password hashing, and multi-factor authentication.

After running the evaluation script, results will be saved to this directory in CSV format.
